 * Used to get the current mode of each elevator. The first time getModes is
 * called, it will return PowerUp mode for all elevators. Then, it will switch
 * modes according to the FireAlarm and MechanicalFailure sensors. When a
 * Failure mode for an elevator ends, that elevator will go into PowerUp mode.
 * 
 * Note that PowerUp mode is only returned once and then it switches to another
 * mode. This is done because OperatingMode does not have a way to know when
 * PowerUp mode has ended. So, when OperatingMode returns PowerUp mode, it is
 * up to the other components to ensure that the elevator knows its position
 * before starting normal operation.
